1. Verify with ZugFinder whether all train delay data for country X is complete.
   German data is not fully complete, not even delay for trains. 

   ice 41

2. Identify alternative data sources if ZugFinder data is missing or incomplete.
    - govdata.de
    - gtfs.de

3. Confirm the official minimum transfer time per station and national transfer protocol.
    - These two numbers are readily available inside of transfers and stops. Transfers include minimum transfer time and stop_id's, and also transfer protocol
    - Take the stops and make a dictionary/array to store them inside of their parent stops(station) parent_x: childx, childy, childz
    - for each station get the minimum transfer time for each transfer protocol
    - So it would look like [station, time, protocol]

4. Determine the minimum PII required for claim filing and confirm with the railway operator.

    - Departure, Destination station with both actual and planned departure/arrival

5. Continuously collect new journeys (up to 3 months old) for eligibility testing.


6. Optimize gathering and caching of reference trips for the route planner.


7. Manually test trip eligibility to refine heuristics.


8. Research GitHub repositories that may support delay detection or route analysis.

9. Engage local train hobbyists or developers to validate technical assumptions.
